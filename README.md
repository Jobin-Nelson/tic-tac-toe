# [Tic-Tac-Toe Game built with React and TypeScript](https://tic-tac-toe-three-pi.vercel.app/)

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game built using React and TypeScript. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark the board with their respective symbols (X or O). The game ends when either a player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column or diagonal, or when the board is filled completely without a winner.
